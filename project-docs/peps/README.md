# Project Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)

## Overview

This directory contains all Project Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) for FHIR4DS development. The PEP process, inspired by Python's PEP system, ensures systematic planning, thorough review, and quality implementation of significant changes to the codebase.

## PEP Process Philosophy

The FHIR4DS PEP process balances thorough planning with efficient execution:

- **Systematic Planning**: Major changes require structured proposals with clear requirements
- **Collaborative Review**: Senior Solution Architect/Engineer reviews all proposals before implementation
- **Quality Focus**: Implementation includes comprehensive testing and compliance validation
- **Knowledge Capture**: Completed PEPs document lessons learned and implementation outcomes

- **400+**: Future categories as project grows

### Current Number Assignment
- **Next Available**: PEP-004 (next major architectural change)
- **Reserved**: Numbers 001-010 for initial major architectural PEPs
- **Most Recent**: PEP-003 (AST-to-SQL Translator) approved 29-09-2025

### Active PEPs
- **[PEP-001](implemented/)**: Testing Infrastructure and Specification Compliance Automation (✅ Completed)

### Managing PEP Process
- **Regular Review**: Schedule regular PEP review sessions
- **Prioritization**: Focus on PEPs that advance compliance and architecture goals
- **Resource Planning**: Align PEP implementation with sprint planning
- **Knowledge Capture**: Ensure implementation lessons are documented and shared

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- **Scope Creep**: Keep PEPs focused on specific, bounded changes
- **Under-specification**: Provide sufficient detail for successful implementation
- **Insufficient Testing**: Plan for comprehensive testing from the beginning
- **Poor Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation throughout process

## Conclusion

The PEP process ensures that FHIR4DS evolves systematically toward 100% specification compliance while maintaining architectural consistency and code quality. By following this structured approach, the development team can deliver significant improvements efficiently while capturing knowledge and lessons learned for future work.

The PEP process is a living framework that will evolve with the project's needs while maintaining its core principles of thorough planning, collaborative review, and quality implementation.
