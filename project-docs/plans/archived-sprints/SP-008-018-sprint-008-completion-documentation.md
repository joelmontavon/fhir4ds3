## Task Overview

### Description

Create comprehensive Sprint 008 completion documentation summarizing all achievements, test results, architecture compliance validation, performance benchmarks, lessons learned, and Sprint 009 preparation. This documentation serves as official sprint completion record and knowledge base for future development.

**Context**: Sprint 008 revealed System 1 (SQL Translation) production-ready at 100% healthcare coverage while establishing System 2 (Evaluation Engine) 70.3% baseline. Comprehensive documentation captures outstanding architectural validation and clear Sprint 009 roadmap.

**Goal**: Publish comprehensive Sprint 008 results report documenting System 1 production readiness, System 2 baseline, all validations, lessons learned, and Sprint 009 handoff.

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-14
**Actual Effort**: 3h (vs 6h estimated)
