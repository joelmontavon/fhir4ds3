# Task: Sprint 009 Plan Creation

**Task ID**: SP-008-017
**Sprint**: 008
**Task Name**: Sprint 009 Plan Creation
**Assignee**: Senior Solution Architect/Engineer + Mid-Level Developer
**Created**: 2025-10-13

## Task Overview

### Description

Collaborate to create comprehensive Sprint 009 plan targeting 100% FHIRPath specification compliance (934/934 tests). Build on SP-008-016 analysis to define detailed task breakdown, timeline, risk assessment, and success criteria for achieving the final compliance milestone.

**Context**: Sprint 008 achieves 95%+ compliance with systematic edge case resolution. Sprint 009 represents the final push to 100%, requiring careful planning of testInheritance implementation, remaining edge cases, and comprehensive validation. This collaborative planning ensures realistic timeline and clear path to 100%.

**Goal**: Create detailed Sprint 009 plan with task breakdown, 3-week timeline, comprehensive risk assessment, and clear roadmap to 100% FHIRPath compliance.

## Implementation Approach

### Implementation Steps

1. **Review SP-008-016 Analysis** (0.5h)
   - Review failure analysis
   - Understand complexity assessment
   - Review effort estimates

2. **Define Sprint 009 Structure** (1h)
   - Primary goal: 100% compliance (934/934)
   - Phase 1: testInheritance (Week 1-2)
   - Phase 2: Remaining edge cases (Week 2-3)
   - Phase 3: PEP-003 closure (Week 3)

3. **Create Task Breakdown** (2h)
   - testInheritance investigation task
   - testInheritance implementation task
   - Remaining edge case tasks
   - Validation and testing tasks
   - PEP-003 implementation summary task

4. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation** (1h)
   - testInheritance complexity risk
   - Timeline risks
   - Architecture risks
   - Mitigation strategies

5. **Document Sprint 009 Plan** (1.5h)
   - Write comprehensive sprint plan
   - Follow Sprint 008 structure
   - Include all sections
   - Publish in current-sprint/
